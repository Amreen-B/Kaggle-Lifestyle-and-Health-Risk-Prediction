# üè• Lifestyle & Health Risk Dataset

Lifestyle and health dataset designed for building and evaluating health risk prediction models. The dataset mimics realistic human wellness data ‚Äî without the use of sensitive or private medical information ‚Äî and is ideal for EDA, classification modeling, and web app development.
This synthetic dataset simulates lifestyle and wellness attributes for 5,000 individuals. It is generated using heuristic, rule-based methods to imitate real-world health risk behavior patterns, making it safe for public experimentation and machine learning workflows.
